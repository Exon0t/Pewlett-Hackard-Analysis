Bobby has been tasked to create a list of workers that are both retireing and are eligible for the retiring package. Bobby 
has now tasked us to create another list to determine the number of retiring employees per title and find employees who are
elgible to participate in a mentorship prgram. 

## Results

* 72,458 people who are about to retire 
* 1,550 of which can become a mentor

* The staf retiring per title are :
  * 25916	Senior Engineer
  * 24926	Senior Staff
  * 9285	Engineer
  * 7636	Staff
  * 3603	Technique Leader
  * 1090	Assistant Engineer
  * 2	Manager


## Summary

There are 72,458 people that are about to retire. 1,550 of whome would be able to participate into a mentor program. The number is only elgible not the full
number of who would participate. Even if we did get all of them and each could menotor 10 new employees that wouldnt even replace half the jobs needed. 
More imformation is need tho needeing to see who can become menotrs based on the title. so we can see who exactly we need to hire to teach the next generration 
of Pewlett Hackard employees.
